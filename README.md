This repository contains code and resources for predicting calories burnt using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for training and evaluation includes calories burnt during physical activites. The data is sourced from reputable sources and preprocessed to ensure accuracy and reliability Approach involves EDA to understand the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. Then employed feature engineering techniques to extract meaningful insights and select the most relevant features for modeling. Several machine learning algorithms,including regression models are implemented and evaluated to determine the best performing model.
